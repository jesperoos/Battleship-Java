# Battleship-Java
A simple battleship game  

- Have tried to use an MVC pattern approach.
- The game only has a text based interface right now.
- Have not implemented an AI player or scoreboard yet (other than some results when game is over).

There are definately flaws that I would like to fix with how the ui presents things to the players. Among other stuff.
